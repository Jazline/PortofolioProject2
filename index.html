                        <p>Welcome to my Portofolio.I hope you can learn as much about me and appreciate the work I have done.<br>
                        I am originally from West Africa more precisely the Ivory Coast, I came to the US about 5 years ago to attend college at the University of Central Arkansas.<br>
                        While in college my major was Finance ,much of the decision was influenced by my parents because I also did not know what I truly wanted to do.Once I got my diploma, I moved to Austin,Texas
                        I fell immediately in love with the city and as I researched more and talked to people I saw the increasing demand for people with a tech background,this is why I took a leap of faith
                        to register for this bootcamp.</p>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-md3-12">
                        <p>On a typical Saturday you would find me dolled up and exploring different restaurants and 'instagrammable' places in Austin.I love the food diversity the city has and the art walls all around the city.
                        I also like watching shows on Netflix and right now I am trying to watch "The Office". <br>I am also a believer in God and thus take my faith journey seriously so you would also find me watching sermons on Youtube and also have lunch,life group and book club meetings with my fellow church members.</p>
